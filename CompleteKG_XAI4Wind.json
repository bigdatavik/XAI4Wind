{"type":"node","id":"20","labels":["Blades"],"properties":{"InspectionActivities":["EVALUATION OF DAMAGE\nMost common types of damage are:\n- Erosion damage (without major fiber damage)\n- Minor scratches or dings affecting surface ply\n- Damage into or beyond outer ply of laminate\n- Damage into sandwich core structure (debonding)\n- Damage though structure (main spar)\n- Bond failures","Reporting:\nThe location of damages and dimension (inspect the leading edge, trailing edge and both\nshells) must be reported in a template designed for this purpose and including pictures.","For inspections the tools and equipment typically used:\n• Posters numbering the blades.\n• Telescope\n• Tripod\n• Camera • Drones","Drones are starting progressively to be used but the blade maientance is normally more\ncomplex because it requires two people: drone pilot and expert on blades","The first step upon arrival is to stop the machine with the rotor on Y position and the hub\nhatched on top, as it will be the reference point for the numbering of the blades.\nOnce the wind turbine is stopped in this position, with two blades up and one blade straight\ndown along the tower, the numbering of the blades is done as represented in the picture\nbelow.","After numbering the blades, it has to proceed to inspect each blade as it is described below,\nwith the blade to be inspected first locked in the straight down position. 1. Taking a picture of the turbine number.\n2. Taking a picture of 􀁗he inspected blade's number.\n3. Setting up equipment to inspect the blade:\n4. Proceding to the blade inspection by surfaces:\n- Setting the leading edge: in front of the turbine\n- Upper shell: the side corresponding to the upper or outer shell\n- Bottom shell: the side corresponding to the lower or inner shell\n- Trailing edge: the rear of the blade slightly to the right facing the rear of the nacelle\n5. Looking for damages and taking pictures as discussed: a picture of the complete blade\nshowing the damage, a picture centered on the damage showing the chord of the blade\nwhere the damage is and a detailed picture of the damage itself should be taken. Note:\nIf necessary, the position of the rotor could be changed to see the total surface of the blade.\nIf necessary, the nacelle could be rotated to prevent sunlight affect the inspection.","The repair approaches can be broadly divided into nonpatch, usually for minor defects, and\npatch, usually for more major defects and damages. However, these two procedures may be\nemployed in combination for some types of repairs. In general for composite material\nstructures there are four basic levels of generic repair designs. Although, not all of them are\napplicable to wind turbine blades, these are listed below:(a) Non-structural or cosmetic repairs. Filling and sealing the damaged areas where damage\nsignificance is minor, but environmental protection is necessary, it is a cosmetic or\nnonstructural repair.\n(b) Semi-structural repair. Filling the internal cavity with an adhesive foam or core\nreplacement and applying a doubler patch to the damaged area is a semi-structural repair.\nThe double patch can be non-load-bearing, either load-bearing or to have some intermediate\nload carrying capacity.\n(c) Adhesively bonded structural repair. A flush patch adhesively bonded over the damaged\narea, is a major structural repair using a scarf of stepped-lap joint. The flush patch is\ngenerally applicable to thin skin structures only.\n(d) Mechanically fastened structural repair. Another structural repair is the bolted patch. This\nis used primarily on thick structural components.","BLADE REPAIR ZONES: In the following figure are presented the repair zones of the blade. 1. For both, aerodynamical and structural purposes; the blade leading must be\nmaintained for the laminar boundary layer. Zone 1 is from the 20% to 100% span\nlength and to 20%-30% of the local chordline. Zone 1 will always require a flush\nrepair.2. For aeroelastic purposes; do not add significant weight to this zone of the blade, so\nas to maintain mass balance. Even not being a major structural region of the blade,\nhowever the repair needs to be an aeroelastic semi-structural repair.\n3. Firtly, for aeroelastic purposes; the repair does not necessarily need to be flushed for\nairflow aerodynamics, but it do not have to add significant weight behind the shear\ncenter. However, trailing edge repairs are typically flushed for aeroelastic\nrequirements.\n4. It does not require to be aerodynamically smooth, but it may need to be a semistructural\nor structural repair based on the severity of the damage and the proximity of\nthe damage to the main load bearing region. Because of the large enclosed area of\nthe blade in this zone, the torsional rigidity is much higher than in other locations in\nzone 3 and aeroelastic requirements are not necessarily critical.","REPAIR PROCEDURE: A typical repair procedure consists of the following steps:\n1. INSPECTION\n2. LAMINATE GRINDING AND CHAMFERING\n3. CLEANING\n4. REPAIR RECORDING\n5. LAMINATE BUILD-UP\n6. EDGE REINFORCEMENT BUILD-UP\n7. ADHESIVE FLANGE BUILD-UP\n8. BASE LAMINATE GRINDING AND CHAMFERING\n9. CLEANING\n10. BASE LAMINATE BUILD-UP\n11. FINISH\nAll of them would be described as follows:\n1. INSPECTION\nThe inspection(already presented) step consist in:- Checking and marking defective areas before repairing.\n- Gathering partly connected defective areas as one larger defective area. This could\nmean that an intact laminate has to be ground off.\n2. LAMINATE GRINDING AND CHAMFERING\n- Grinding defective areas avoiding air bubbles, foreign matters, cracks or dry glass.\n- In the event that the blade demoulding has not been performed yet, max. 2/3 of the\ntotal glass layer should be grounded off. If dry glass or air bubbles still appear, the\ninternal grindings should be stopped to perform the repair.\n- After demoulding, the blade would repaired from the outside.\nMain laminate\nThe bottom of the grinded defective area must be rectangle-shaped in order to ease the\nsubsequent laminate build-up.\nEdge reinforcement (UD-laminate)\nThe bottom of the grinded defective area must be rectangle-shaped in order to ease the\nsubsequent laminate build-up.\nTowards blade assembly it may be advantageous to remove all glass in the layer to be\nground. This is an alternative to chamfering.\nIn case of internal blade repairs\nWhen chamfering is performed in core material, the chamfering procedure should continue to\nmatch the normal core material chamfering.\nAbove the core material, the overlapping grinding would be measured prior to re-continuing\nthe chamfering procedure.\nAny chamfering made should appear evened.\n3. CLEANING\nThe surface of the ground laminate should be vacuum-cleaned using a mouthpiece with stiff\nbrushes. All abrasive dust should be removed.4. REPAIR RECORDING\nAll the repair data should be notee down including the following aspects:\n- Defective extension.\n- Repair extension including chamfering\n- Number of ground-off glass layers\n- Type of ground-off glass layers\n- Any consolidation of the main laminate repair\n5. LAMINATE BUILD-UP\nTo build-up the laminate the following requirements should be met:\n- Prior to build-up, polyester should be rubbed hand laid-up into the entire surface\nusing a stiff brush or paintbrush.\n- The glass has to be rolled thoroughly between each layer.\nProcedure:\n- Apply ingfiberglass layers according to the number of fractured layers recorded.\n- Offset each layer along fibre direction and across fibre direction starting from the\nlarge-sized layer.\n- Applying glass in such a way that length ends project from the final level of the\nrepaired area.\n- Laminate must be cured until the polyester has peaked and temperature is\ndecreased.\n- In the event that the repaired area size requires several glass layers, the chamfering\nhas to be checked and improved prior to applying a new glass layer.\n- Checking the newly applied glass for irregularities/buckling.\n6. EDGE REINFORCEMENT BUILD-UP\nRequirements: - Prior to build-up, a polyester lay-up should be rubbed by hand into the entire surface\nusing a stiff brush or paintbrush.\n- The glass should be rolled thoroughly between each layer.\nEdge reinforcement build-up prior to blade closure\n- Glass layers should be applied according to the number of fractured layers recorded.\n- Towards the blade assembly, applying glass until reaching the level prescribed in the\nblade moulding working instruction. It is necessary to comply with the glass levels\nspecified, i.e. offsetting away from leading and trailing edges, and this particularly\napplies to the trailing edge as the blade thickness will otherwise increase, thus,\ncausing problems during blade assembly.\n- Offseting each layer along fibre direction and across fibre direction away from the\nblade assembly, starting from the large-sized layer.\n- Applying glass in such a way that length ends project from the final level of the\nrepaired area.\n- Laminate must cure until the polyester has peaked and temperature is decreased.\n- In the event that the repaired area size need several glass layers, the chamfering\nshould be checked and improved prior to applying a new glass layer.\n- Checking newly applied glass for irregularities/buckling. In the start-up of the build-up\nprocedure, if any irregularities/buckling are detected in the newly applied glass, it\nshould be grinded off.\n7. ADHESIVE FLANGE BUILD-UP\nRequirements:\n- Prior to build-up, a hand of a polyester lay-up should be rubbed into the entire surface\nusing a stiff brush or paintbrush.\n- Rolling the glass thoroughly between each layer.\nProcedure:\n- Applying the glass layers according to the number of fractured layers recorded,\nstarting from the large-sized layer, with CSM side facing upwards.\n- In the event that all adhesive flange width has been grounded off, each layer would\nbe offset longitudinally. Offseting in transversal blade direction depends on the\noriginal offseting of the adhesive flanges.\n- In the event that only one part of the adhesive flange width has been ground off, each\nlayer should be offset longitudinally and transversally.\n- After building-up the repair laminate, an extra layer shall be applied on the repair with\nan longitudinal and transversal overlap\n- Laminate must cure until the polyester has peaked and temperature is decreased.\n8. BASE LAMINATE GRINDING AND CHAMFERING\n- Grinding off all projecting laminate ends in order for the bottom of the defect to\nappear as an even surface.\n- Chamfering each base of laminate layer longitudinally and transversely.\n- Any chamfering made should appear evened. This should be checked by means of a\nsurface plate.\n- Grinding off gel-coat in wide area along the edge.\n9. CLEANING\nIt is the same cleaning procedure described in the third step.\n10. FINISH\nPrior to finish, the re-inspection of repaired blade area must be performed. Finally, the finish\non the repaired blade area should be performed."],"PreventiveActivities":["First it is necessary to remove the blade drive crashes.

There are three basic tests for all UTP cables: wiremap, length and\nhigh speed performance.\nWiremap\nWiremap tests to make sure the cable is connected properly, according to the standard for\nconnecting pin-to-pin. Basically, wiremap is a continuity test using an inexpensive tester. Wiremapping simple means that each wire is hooked up correctly, with no opens or shorts.\nThat's mostly very straightforward. Each pair must be connected to the correct pins at the\nplugs and jacks, with good contacts in the terminations. Most of the failures are simple enough to understand, like reversed wires in a pair, crossed\npairs, opens or shorts. One possible failure, crossed pairs, is caused when both wires of a\npair are crossed at one termination. The usual cause of a crossed pair is a 568A termination\non one end and a 568B on the other.\nThe most difficult wiremap problem is a split pair, when one wire on each pair is reversed on\nboth ends. It causes the signal to be sent on one wire each of two pairs. The usual DC\nwiremap will pass but crosstalk will fail. It takes a more sophisticated wiremapper or Cat 5e/6\ntester to find a split pair, as some wiremappers which use only DC tests do not check\ncrosstalk. In our experience, a split pair is usually caused by someone using punchdown\ncolor codes on jacks which splits the pairs.","Length:Test is done with a time domain reflectometer which is a fancy term for cable radar. The\ntester sends out a pulse, waits for an echo from the far end and measures the time it took\nfor the trip. Knowing the speed in the cable, it calculates the length. All cable certification\ntesters include a TDR to measure length.\nIf you have a short or open, the TDR will also tell you where the problem is, making it a great\ntool for troubleshooting problems.","Attenuation: The proper operation of a LAN on the cable plant requires the signal strength be high enough\nat the receiver end. Thus the attenuation of the cable is very important. Since LANs send\nhigh speed signals through the cable and the attenuation is variable with the frequency of the\nsignal, certification testers test attenuation at several frequencies.\nThis test requires a tester at each end of the cable, one to send and one to receive, then one\nof them will calculate the loss and record it. There are pass fail criteria for the cable at Cat 3,\n4, 5, 5e, and 6 max frequencies.","Crosstalk (NEXT): It's called NEXT for near end cross talk since it measures the crosstalk (signal coupled from\none pair to another) at the end where one pair is transmitting (so the transmitted signal is\nlargest causing the most crosstalk.) Crosstalk is minimized by the twists in the cable, with\ndifferent twist rates causing each pair to be antennas sensitive to different frequencies and\nhopefully not picking up the signals from it's neighboring pairs. You MUST keep the twists as\nclose to the terminations as possible to minimize crosstalk.\nCat 5e /6 testers measure crosstalk from one pair to all three other pairs for each pair and\ncompare it to the cable specifications, giving a pass/fail result. Some also calculate ACR or attenuation/crosstalk ratio, as it is a measure of how big the crosstalk signal is to the\nattenuated signal at the receiver. You want this number as big as possible, as it is an\nindication of the signal to noise ratio.","More Tests for Gigabit Ethernet: The latest generation of test specs for Category 5e and 6 includes a number of new tests to\ninsure higher performance from the cable. These tests relate to higher bandwidth usage of\nthe cable and simultaneous use of all four pairs, even in both directions at once.\nPowersum NEXT is the NEXT on one pair when all three others are carrying signals. This is\nrealistic with 1000Base-T Gigabit Ethernet where all pairs carry signals simultaneously.\nFar end crosstalk, looking at the effect of the coupling from one pair to another over the\nentire length, measured at the far end. As tested, it's ELFEXT or equal level FEXT, or the\nratio of FEXT to attenuation, sort of like ACR.\nDelay Skew measures how much simultaneous pulses on all 4 pairs spread out at the far\nend. This measures the speed on each pair, which may be different due to the variations in\nnumber of twists (more twists means longer wires) or insulation. Since 1000Base-T Gigabit\nEthernet uses all 4 pairs with the signals split into 4 separate signals, it's necesary to have all\narrive simultaneously. Testers measure Propogation Delay, the actual transit time on the\npairs to calculate Delay Skew.\nReturn Loss is a measure of the reflections from the cable due to variations in the\nimpedance. These reflections can cause signal degradation, especially if the pairs are used\nin a full-duplex (bidirectional) mode. With 1000Base-T Gigabit Ethernet transmitting in both\ndirections on each pair, return loss can cause big problems.\nThe augmented Cat 6 spec will have reference to alien crosstalk or the signal coupling\nfrom one pair in a cable to the same pair in another cable, a consequence of higher\nfrequencies and the consistency of twists.","Testers: Wiremappers test the connections and Cat 5e/6 certification testers test the performance at\nhigh frequencies. Cable Certification testers are mostly automated, push a button get a\npass/fail simple. In fact, certification testers test everything, wiremap, length, attenuation and\ncrosstalk in one connection, give you a pass/fail result, help on troubleshooting and store the\nresult for printing reports for the customer.\nSome installers use the certification tester for all testing, after the cable is installed. But it's a\nvery expensive unit that needs a trained operator and many failures are simply wire map\nproblems. Others have each crew use an inexpensive wiremapper to make sure all\nconnections are correct before the certification tester is brought in. By having each crew find\nand fix their own wiremap problems, testing and corrections are done as the cable is installed\nand the cost of the certification tester is not wasted on simple problems. It's just provides the\nhigh frequency tests and documentation required by most users.","Host Addressing: For purpose of addressing network layer uses a specific kind of addressing scheme called IP\nAddress (Logical Address). IP address is composed of 32 binary bits. Its written  in decimal\nform using 4 octets (1 octet is of 8 bits) (32 / 8 = 4). Example of IP address version 4 octets\n192.168.5.10. IP address contains two part in them  Network part and Host part. Host part\ndefines unique address of host and network part define network of that host (to which\nnetwork host belongs). Network is kind of group and hosts are people in them. Two different\nnetworks cannot communicate with each other at layer 2 but can communicate using layer 3\nMessage Forwarding devices (Layer 3 Devices)."]}}

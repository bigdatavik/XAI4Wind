"{""InspectionActivities"":[EVALUATION OF DAMAGE
Most common types of damage are:
- Erosion damage (without major fiber damage)
- Minor scratches or dings affecting surface ply
- Damage into or beyond outer ply of laminate
- Damage into sandwich core structure (debonding)
- Damage though structure (main spar)
- Bond failures,Reporting:
The location of damages and dimension (inspect the leading edge, trailing edge and both
shells) must be reported in a template designed for this purpose and including pictures.,For inspections the tools and equipment typically used:
• Posters numbering the blades.
• Telescope
• Tripod
• Camera • Drones,Drones are starting progressively to be used but the blade maientance is normally more
complex because it requires two people: drone pilot and expert on blades,The first step upon arrival is to stop the machine with the rotor on Y position and the hub
hatched on top, as it will be the reference point for the numbering of the blades.
Once the wind turbine is stopped in this position, with two blades up and one blade straight
down along the tower, the numbering of the blades is done as represented in the picture
below.,After numbering the blades, it has to proceed to inspect each blade as it is described below,
with the blade to be inspected first locked in the straight down position. 1. Taking a picture of the turbine number.
2. Taking a picture of 􀁗he inspected blade's number.
3. Setting up equipment to inspect the blade:
4. Proceding to the blade inspection by surfaces:
- Setting the leading edge: in front of the turbine
- Upper shell: the side corresponding to the upper or outer shell
- Bottom shell: the side corresponding to the lower or inner shell
- Trailing edge: the rear of the blade slightly to the right facing the rear of the nacelle
5. Looking for damages and taking pictures as discussed: a picture of the complete blade
showing the damage, a picture centered on the damage showing the chord of the blade
where the damage is and a detailed picture of the damage itself should be taken. Note:
If necessary, the position of the rotor could be changed to see the total surface of the blade.
If necessary, the nacelle could be rotated to prevent sunlight affect the inspection.,The repair approaches can be broadly divided into nonpatch, usually for minor defects, and
patch, usually for more major defects and damages. However, these two procedures may be
employed in combination for some types of repairs. In general for composite material
structures there are four basic levels of generic repair designs. Although, not all of them are
applicable to wind turbine blades, these are listed below:(a) Non-structural or cosmetic repairs. Filling and sealing the damaged areas where damage
significance is minor, but environmental protection is necessary, it is a cosmetic or
nonstructural repair.
(b) Semi-structural repair. Filling the internal cavity with an adhesive foam or core
replacement and applying a doubler patch to the damaged area is a semi-structural repair.
The double patch can be non-load-bearing, either load-bearing or to have some intermediate
load carrying capacity.
(c) Adhesively bonded structural repair. A flush patch adhesively bonded over the damaged
area, is a major structural repair using a scarf of stepped-lap joint. The flush patch is
generally applicable to thin skin structures only.
(d) Mechanically fastened structural repair. Another structural repair is the bolted patch. This
is used primarily on thick structural components.,BLADE REPAIR ZONES: In the following figure are presented the repair zones of the blade. 1. For both, aerodynamical and structural purposes; the blade leading must be
maintained for the laminar boundary layer. Zone 1 is from the 20% to 100% span
length and to 20%-30% of the local chordline. Zone 1 will always require a flush
repair.2. For aeroelastic purposes; do not add significant weight to this zone of the blade, so
as to maintain mass balance. Even not being a major structural region of the blade,
however the repair needs to be an aeroelastic semi-structural repair.
3. Firtly, for aeroelastic purposes; the repair does not necessarily need to be flushed for
airflow aerodynamics, but it do not have to add significant weight behind the shear
center. However, trailing edge repairs are typically flushed for aeroelastic
requirements.
4. It does not require to be aerodynamically smooth, but it may need to be a semistructural
or structural repair based on the severity of the damage and the proximity of
the damage to the main load bearing region. Because of the large enclosed area of
the blade in this zone, the torsional rigidity is much higher than in other locations in
zone 3 and aeroelastic requirements are not necessarily critical.,REPAIR PROCEDURE: A typical repair procedure consists of the following steps:
1. INSPECTION
2. LAMINATE GRINDING AND CHAMFERING
3. CLEANING
4. REPAIR RECORDING
5. LAMINATE BUILD-UP
6. EDGE REINFORCEMENT BUILD-UP
7. ADHESIVE FLANGE BUILD-UP
8. BASE LAMINATE GRINDING AND CHAMFERING
9. CLEANING
10. BASE LAMINATE BUILD-UP
11. FINISH
All of them would be described as follows:
1. INSPECTION
The inspection(already presented) step consist in:- Checking and marking defective areas before repairing.
- Gathering partly connected defective areas as one larger defective area. This could
mean that an intact laminate has to be ground off.
2. LAMINATE GRINDING AND CHAMFERING
- Grinding defective areas avoiding air bubbles, foreign matters, cracks or dry glass.
- In the event that the blade demoulding has not been performed yet, max. 2/3 of the
total glass layer should be grounded off. If dry glass or air bubbles still appear, the
internal grindings should be stopped to perform the repair.
- After demoulding, the blade would repaired from the outside.
Main laminate
The bottom of the grinded defective area must be rectangle-shaped in order to ease the
subsequent laminate build-up.
Edge reinforcement (UD-laminate)
The bottom of the grinded defective area must be rectangle-shaped in order to ease the
subsequent laminate build-up.
Towards blade assembly it may be advantageous to remove all glass in the layer to be
ground. This is an alternative to chamfering.
In case of internal blade repairs
When chamfering is performed in core material, the chamfering procedure should continue to
match the normal core material chamfering.
Above the core material, the overlapping grinding would be measured prior to re-continuing
the chamfering procedure.
Any chamfering made should appear evened.
3. CLEANING
The surface of the ground laminate should be vacuum-cleaned using a mouthpiece with stiff
brushes. All abrasive dust should be removed.4. REPAIR RECORDING
All the repair data should be notee down including the following aspects:
- Defective extension.
- Repair extension including chamfering
- Number of ground-off glass layers
- Type of ground-off glass layers
- Any consolidation of the main laminate repair
5. LAMINATE BUILD-UP
To build-up the laminate the following requirements should be met:
- Prior to build-up, polyester should be rubbed hand laid-up into the entire surface
using a stiff brush or paintbrush.
- The glass has to be rolled thoroughly between each layer.
Procedure:
- Apply ingfiberglass layers according to the number of fractured layers recorded.
- Offset each layer along fibre direction and across fibre direction starting from the
large-sized layer.
- Applying glass in such a way that length ends project from the final level of the
repaired area.
- Laminate must be cured until the polyester has peaked and temperature is
decreased.
- In the event that the repaired area size requires several glass layers, the chamfering
has to be checked and improved prior to applying a new glass layer.
- Checking the newly applied glass for irregularities/buckling.
6. EDGE REINFORCEMENT BUILD-UP
Requirements: - Prior to build-up, a polyester lay-up should be rubbed by hand into the entire surface
using a stiff brush or paintbrush.
- The glass should be rolled thoroughly between each layer.
Edge reinforcement build-up prior to blade closure
- Glass layers should be applied according to the number of fractured layers recorded.
- Towards the blade assembly, applying glass until reaching the level prescribed in the
blade moulding working instruction. It is necessary to comply with the glass levels
specified, i.e. offsetting away from leading and trailing edges, and this particularly
applies to the trailing edge as the blade thickness will otherwise increase, thus,
causing problems during blade assembly.
- Offseting each layer along fibre direction and across fibre direction away from the
blade assembly, starting from the large-sized layer.
- Applying glass in such a way that length ends project from the final level of the
repaired area.
- Laminate must cure until the polyester has peaked and temperature is decreased.
- In the event that the repaired area size need several glass layers, the chamfering
should be checked and improved prior to applying a new glass layer.
- Checking newly applied glass for irregularities/buckling. In the start-up of the build-up
procedure, if any irregularities/buckling are detected in the newly applied glass, it
should be grinded off.
7. ADHESIVE FLANGE BUILD-UP
Requirements:
- Prior to build-up, a hand of a polyester lay-up should be rubbed into the entire surface
using a stiff brush or paintbrush.
- Rolling the glass thoroughly between each layer.
Procedure:
- Applying the glass layers according to the number of fractured layers recorded,
starting from the large-sized layer, with CSM side facing upwards.
- In the event that all adhesive flange width has been grounded off, each layer would
be offset longitudinally. Offseting in transversal blade direction depends on the
original offseting of the adhesive flanges.
- In the event that only one part of the adhesive flange width has been ground off, each
layer should be offset longitudinally and transversally.
- After building-up the repair laminate, an extra layer shall be applied on the repair with
an longitudinal and transversal overlap
- Laminate must cure until the polyester has peaked and temperature is decreased.
8. BASE LAMINATE GRINDING AND CHAMFERING
- Grinding off all projecting laminate ends in order for the bottom of the defect to
appear as an even surface.
- Chamfering each base of laminate layer longitudinally and transversely.
- Any chamfering made should appear evened. This should be checked by means of a
surface plate.
- Grinding off gel-coat in wide area along the edge.
9. CLEANING
It is the same cleaning procedure described in the third step.
10. FINISH
Prior to finish, the re-inspection of repaired blade area must be performed. Finally, the finish
on the repaired blade area should be performed.],""PreventiveActivities"":[First it is necessary to remove the blade drive crashes. The rotor has to be blocked and this
test should be performed with wind speed under 9 meter pers second(11 meters per second

Since UTP Cat 5e/6/6A cable is used to the fullest extent of its performance envelope,
testing is very important. There are three basic tests for all UTP cables: wiremap, length and
high speed performance.
Wiremap
Wiremap tests to make sure the cable is connected properly, according to the standard for
connecting pin-to-pin. Basically, wiremap is a continuity test using an inexpensive tester. Wiremapping simple means that each wire is hooked up correctly, with no opens or shorts.
That's mostly very straightforward. Each pair must be connected to the correct pins at the
plugs and jacks, with good contacts in the terminations. Most of the failures are simple enough to understand, like reversed wires in a pair, crossed
pairs, opens or shorts. One possible failure, crossed pairs, is caused when both wires of a
pair are crossed at one termination. The usual cause of a crossed pair is a 568A termination
on one end and a 568B on the other.
The most difficult wiremap problem is a split pair, when one wire on each pair is reversed on
both ends. It causes the signal to be sent on one wire each of two pairs. The usual DC
wiremap will pass but crosstalk will fail. It takes a more sophisticated wiremapper or Cat 5e/6
tester to find a split pair, as some wiremappers which use only DC tests do not check
crosstalk. In our experience, a split pair is usually caused by someone using punchdown
color codes on jacks which splits the pairs.,Length:Test is done with a time domain reflectometer which is a fancy term for cable radar. The
tester sends out a pulse, waits for an echo from the far end and measures the time it took
for the trip. Knowing the speed in the cable, it calculates the length. All cable certification
testers include a TDR to measure length.
If you have a short or open, the TDR will also tell you where the problem is, making it a great
tool for troubleshooting problems.,Attenuation: The proper operation of a LAN on the cable plant requires the signal strength be high enough
at the receiver end. Thus the attenuation of the cable is very important. Since LANs send
high speed signals through the cable and the attenuation is variable with the frequency of the
signal, certification testers test attenuation at several frequencies.
This test requires a tester at each end of the cable, one to send and one to receive, then one
of them will calculate the loss and record it. There are pass fail criteria for the cable at Cat 3,
4, 5, 5e, and 6 max frequencies.,Crosstalk (NEXT): It's called NEXT for near end cross talk since it measures the crosstalk (signal coupled from
one pair to another) at the end where one pair is transmitting (so the transmitted signal is
largest causing the most crosstalk.) Crosstalk is minimized by the twists in the cable, with
different twist rates causing each pair to be antennas sensitive to different frequencies and
hopefully not picking up the signals from it's neighboring pairs. You MUST keep the twists as
close to the terminations as possible to minimize crosstalk.
Cat 5e /6 testers measure crosstalk from one pair to all three other pairs for each pair and
compare it to the cable specifications, giving a pass/fail result. Some also calculate ACR or attenuation/crosstalk ratio, as it is a measure of how big the crosstalk signal is to the
attenuated signal at the receiver. You want this number as big as possible, as it is an
indication of the signal to noise ratio.,More Tests for Gigabit Ethernet: The latest generation of test specs for Category 5e and 6 includes a number of new tests to
insure higher performance from the cable. These tests relate to higher bandwidth usage of
the cable and simultaneous use of all four pairs, even in both directions at once.
Powersum NEXT is the NEXT on one pair when all three others are carrying signals. This is
realistic with 1000Base-T Gigabit Ethernet where all pairs carry signals simultaneously.
Far end crosstalk, looking at the effect of the coupling from one pair to another over the
entire length, measured at the far end. As tested, it's ELFEXT or equal level FEXT, or the
ratio of FEXT to attenuation, sort of like ACR.
Delay Skew measures how much simultaneous pulses on all 4 pairs spread out at the far
end. This measures the speed on each pair, which may be different due to the variations in
number of twists (more twists means longer wires) or insulation. Since 1000Base-T Gigabit
Ethernet uses all 4 pairs with the signals split into 4 separate signals, it's necesary to have all
arrive simultaneously. Testers measure Propogation Delay, the actual transit time on the
pairs to calculate Delay Skew.
Return Loss is a measure of the reflections from the cable due to variations in the
impedance. These reflections can cause signal degradation, especially if the pairs are used
in a full-duplex (bidirectional) mode. With 1000Base-T Gigabit Ethernet transmitting in both
directions on each pair, return loss can cause big problems.
The augmented Cat 6 spec will have reference to alien crosstalk or the signal coupling
from one pair in a cable to the same pair in another cable, a consequence of higher
frequencies and the consistency of twists.,Testers: Wiremappers test the connections and Cat 5e/6 certification testers test the performance at
high frequencies. Cable Certification testers are mostly automated, push a button get a
pass/fail simple. In fact, certification testers test everything, wiremap, length, attenuation and
crosstalk in one connection, give you a pass/fail result, help on troubleshooting and store the
result for printing reports for the customer.
Some installers use the certification tester for all testing, after the cable is installed. But it's a
very expensive unit that needs a trained operator and many failures are simply wire map
problems. Others have each crew use an inexpensive wiremapper to make sure all
connections are correct before the certification tester is brought in. By having each crew find
and fix their own wiremap problems, testing and corrections are done as the cable is installed
and the cost of the certification tester is not wasted on simple problems. It's just provides the
high frequency tests and documentation required by most users.,Host Addressing: For purpose of addressing network layer uses a specific kind of addressing scheme called IP
Address (Logical Address). IP address is composed of 32 binary bits. Its written  in decimal
form using 4 octets (1 octet is of 8 bits) (32 / 8 = 4). Example of IP address version 4 octets
192.168.5.10. IP address contains two part in them  Network part and Host part. Host part
defines unique address of host and network part define network of that host (to which
network host belongs). Network is kind of group and hosts are people in them. Two different
networks cannot communicate with each other at layer 2 but can communicate using layer 3
Message Forwarding devices (Layer 3 Devices).]}"

higher that usual consumption is detected it may be sign of engine damage, either
mechanical by friction with the bearing or electrical if the coil spires are short-circuited their
substitution will be evaluated or their repairing in a specialized repair factory.

The liquid pressure is to be verified form the manometer of the pumping station. If it is low, it
may be a leak or a malfunction of the expansion tank, breakdown and flooding of the internal bag or simply a loss of nitrogen. For more details, please revise the station manual in the
section expansion tank.,􀁸 Liquid leaks.
It has to be observed in connectors and fittings the presence of oxide or lime marks that may
indicate possibly a fluid leak. In this case it has to be considered the substitution of the
affected fitting or simply revise its assembly just in case it has only loosened. In addition, the
over pressured valves and the air evacuation are to be checked.,􀁸 Fast connectors.
They are devices that allow the disconnection of the circuit without any liquid loss allowing
the substitution of components without needing to empty the circuit. These mechanisms have
a check valve with a spring closure. This spring could oxide, break down and accumulate
particles that may lead to brake or block the fluid flow resulting in an efficiency loss. It is
recommended to unplug every connector and check the lack of sediments and the good
operation of the spring system and the check valve closure assuring that the fluid circulates
with the minimum resistance. In case of defect or sediment excess it is recommended to
change it.,􀁸 Liquid state.
The estate of the liquid has to be checked and if it contains sediments or dirt it has to be
evaluated the possibility of its substitution. The circulation of sediments may block the fast
connectors or break down the pump.,􀁸 Heat exchanger.
